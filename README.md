# so_long

So_long is a 2D game made in C. It uses the minilibx library, a simple graphics lib.

The objective is to collect all the jars. When you do so, you can step onto the portal to end the game. The character can be controlled with WASD, and ESC can be used to close the window.

To play, clone the repository and compile with make.
